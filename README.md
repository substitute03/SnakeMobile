# SnakeMobile
SnakeMobile is the classic Snake game built in .NET and Xamarin.

## Overview

The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible by guiding the Snake to consume pellets. Each time a pellet is consumed, the Snake will become one block longer.
You will get a game over if the Snake either goes out of bounds or collides with itself.


## Controls

The Snake is controlled using the swipe commands, or using on screen buttons. You can select a control scheme before the game starts.

## Device

The game was built and optimised for the Google Nexus 7.
